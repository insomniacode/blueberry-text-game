blueberry-text-game
===================

First *real* program that I wrote by myself in Ruby. Uploading it here since I need to learn how to use this site and how to program in Ruby. I want to eventually start a career as a programmer and relocate somewhere else than the snowy state I'm currently in.

Inspiration is drawn from the local blueberry u-pick that near me and loosely based off of Exercise 31 in Learn Ruby the Hard Way.

Future changes concerning this project will be adding recursion (since I think that's how I get back up to the top level if-else statements? Not quite sure yet and it's reeallllllly late at night/early in the morning here).
