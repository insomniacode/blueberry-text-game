blueberry-text-game
===================

First *real* program that I wrote by myself. Uploading it here since I need to learn how to use this site and how to program in Ruby. I want to eventually start a career as a programmer and relocate somewhere else than the snowy state I'm currently in.

Inspiration is drawn from the local blueberry u-pick that near me and loosely based off of Exercise 31 in Learn Ruby the Hard Way.

Future changes concerning this project will be adding looping for different levels and more level if-else statements? Not quite sure yet and it's reeallllllly late at night/early in the morning here).
